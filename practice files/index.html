              <p>
                My name is Richard Huynh and I am a Freshman at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Engineering.
                I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School and Highline College on June 2022, earning both a high school diploma
                and an associate's degree. I am now currently striving for my bachelor's degree in computer engineering at the
                University of Washington. In accepting my role as a student at UW, I was given the opportunity to join UW's
                Startup program and I look forward to making it a worthwhile experience.
